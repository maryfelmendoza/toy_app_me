# Toy App Me Project

I developed a toy demo application to show off some of the power of Rails. The purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically.

The resulting toy app will allow us to interact with it through its URLs, giving us insight into the structure of a Rails application, including a first example of the REST architecture favored by Rails.

I started by generating the application skeleton using the rails new command with a specific Rails version number.
